# Implementation Complete: Crew-Based & Direct Resource Assignment System

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: ✅ API Layer Complete, Frontend Pending
**Commit**: `ceb2f16`

## Overview

Implemented a flexible resource assignment system where equipment and vehicles can be assigned:
1. **To crews** (which are assigned to projects) - crew-based assignments
2. **Directly to projects** (bypassing crews) - direct assignments

Project resource views now show **both types** with clear visual indicators.

## Critical Discovery

**No database migration was needed!** The schema was already correct:
- `equipment_assignments.crew_id` - nullable (uuid)
- `vehicle_assignments.crew_id` - nullable (uuid)

## Changes Implemented

### Phase 1: Database Layer
**Status**: ✅ No changes needed - schema already correct

### Phase 2: API Layer Updates
**Status**: ✅ Complete

#### File 1: `/src/app/api/projects/[id]/resources/route.ts`
**What Changed**: Complete rewrite of GET endpoint

**Before**: Only fetched direct project assignments (missing crew-based resources)

**After**:
- Fetches all crews assigned to the project
- Queries crew-based equipment assignments (via crew_id IN crewIds)
- Queries direct project assignments (crew_id IS NULL)
- Merges both with `assignment_source` flag ('crew_based' | 'direct')
- Includes crew relationship data (id, name) for crew-based assignments

**New Response Structure**:
```typescript
{
  equipment: [
    {
      ...assignment_data,
      equipment: { ...equipment_details },
      crew: { id, name },              // Only on crew_based
      assignment_source: 'crew_based'   // or 'direct'
    }
  ],
  vehicles: [...same structure],
  materials: [...unchanged]
}
```

#### File 2: `/src/app/api/resources/equipment-assignments/route.ts`
**What Changed**: POST validation logic

**Key Updates**:
- `crew_id` is now **optional** (was required)
- `project_id` is now **required**
- Added crew validation: if crew_id provided, verifies crew belongs to project
- Added concurrent assignment prevention: checks if equipment already assigned to another active crew
- Error messages include crew names for better UX

**Validation Flow**:
```
1. Require: equipment_id + project_id
2. If crew_id provided:
   a. Validate crew exists and belongs to project
   b. Check no concurrent crew assignments (is_active=true, crew_id NOT NULL)
   c. Return friendly error with crew name if conflict
3. Allow crew_id = null for direct project assignments
```

#### File 3: `/src/app/api/resources/vehicle-assignments/route.ts`
**What Changed**: Identical updates to equipment-assignments

**Key Updates**:
- Same validation pattern as equipment
- Concurrent assignment prevention
- Crew validation
- Flexible crew_id (optional)

### Phase 3: Frontend Updates
**Status**: ✅ Types Updated, UI Pending

#### File 4: `/src/hooks/use-resources.ts`
**What Changed**: TypeScript interfaces and new hook

**Added Fields to Interfaces**:
```typescript
// ProjectResource, Vehicle, Equipment interfaces
assignment_source?: 'crew_based' | 'direct';
crew?: { id: string; name: string };
is_active?: boolean;
from_ts?: string;
to_ts?: string;
```

**Updated Interfaces**:
```typescript
VehicleAssignmentData {
  crew_id?: string | null;  // Now optional
}

EquipmentAssignmentData {
  crew_id?: string | null;  // Now optional
}
```

**New Interface**:
```typescript
export interface Crew {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  status: string;
  project_id: string;
}
```

**New Hook**:
```typescript
export function useProjectCrews(projectId: string) {
  // Fetches crews assigned to a project
  // Uses existing /api/crews?project_id=X endpoint
}
```

## What's Left: Frontend UI Updates

### Required Changes to `/src/components/project-preparation/resources.tsx`

#### 1. Add Crew Selection State
```typescript
const [assignmentType, setAssignmentType] = useState<'crew' | 'project'>('crew');
const { data: projectCrews } = useProjectCrews(projectId);
```

#### 2. Add Assignment Type Toggle in Forms
```typescript
<div>
  <Label>Assignment Type</Label>
  <Select value={assignmentType} onValueChange={setAssignmentType}>
    <SelectItem value="crew">Assign to Crew</SelectItem>
    <SelectItem value="project">Assign Directly to Project</SelectItem>
  </Select>
</div>

{assignmentType === 'crew' && (
  <div>
    <Label>Select Crew</Label>
    <Select onValueChange={(value) => form.setValue('crew_id', value)}>
      {projectCrews?.map(crew => (
        <SelectItem key={crew.id} value={crew.id}>
          {crew.name}
        </SelectItem>
      ))}
    </Select>
  </div>
)}
```

#### 3. Add Visual Indicators in Resource Cards
```typescript
{/* Assignment Source Badge */}
{resource.assignment_source === 'crew_based' ? (
  <Badge variant="outline" className="flex items-center gap-1">
    <Users className="w-3 h-3" />
    Via Crew: {resource.crew?.name}
  </Badge>
) : (
  <Badge variant="default">
    Direct Assignment
  </Badge>
)}

{/* Expired Badge */}
{resource.to_ts && new Date(resource.to_ts) < new Date() && (
  <Badge variant="secondary" className="text-gray-500">
    Expired
  </Badge>
)}

{/* Active Status */}
{resource.is_active ? (
  <Badge variant="success">Active</Badge>
) : (
  <Badge variant="secondary">Inactive</Badge>
)}
```

#### 4. Update Form Submission Logic
```typescript
const onSubmitEquipment = async (data: EquipmentAssignmentForm) => {
  await createEquipmentAssignment.mutateAsync({
    project_id: projectId,
    equipment_id: data.equipment_id,
    crew_id: assignmentType === 'crew' ? data.crew_id : null,
    from_date: data.from_date,
    to_date: data.to_date,
    is_permanent: data.is_permanent,
    notes: data.notes,
  });
};
```

## Testing Checklist

### Backend API Tests (Completed)
- ✅ Equipment assignment API validates crew_id is optional
- ✅ Vehicle assignment API validates crew_id is optional
- ✅ Concurrent assignment prevention works (same resource can't be on multiple crews)
- ✅ Crew validation ensures crew belongs to project
- ✅ Project resources endpoint fetches both crew-based and direct assignments
- ✅ Response includes assignment_source and crew data

### Frontend Tests (Pending Implementation)
- [ ] Crew dropdown shows only crews assigned to current project
- [ ] Assignment type toggle switches between crew/project modes
- [ ] Direct project assignment (crew_id=null) creates successfully
- [ ] Crew assignment with valid crew_id creates successfully
- [ ] Resource cards display correct badges (crew-based vs direct)
- [ ] Expired assignments show with gray badge
- [ ] Active/inactive status displayed correctly
- [ ] Concurrent assignment error displays crew name in error message
- [ ] Rental forms support both assignment types

### Integration Tests (Pending)
- [ ] Create crew → Assign resources → View in project resources
- [ ] Create direct assignment → Verify shows as "Direct Assignment"
- [ ] Try to assign same equipment to two crews → Verify error
- [ ] End crew assignment → Verify can assign to another crew
- [ ] Filter/sort resources by assignment type
- [ ] Export/report includes assignment source data

## Business Rules Implemented

### 1. Concurrent Assignment Prevention
- ✅ One equipment can only be on ONE active crew at a time
- ✅ One vehicle can only be on ONE active crew at a time
- ✅ Direct project assignments (crew_id=null) are allowed alongside crew assignments
- ✅ Must end existing assignment before creating new crew assignment

### 2. Crew Validation
- ✅ If crew_id provided, must belong to the project
- ✅ Returns friendly error if crew not found or wrong project

### 3. Flexible Assignment Types
- ✅ Resources can be assigned to crews
- ✅ Resources can be assigned directly to projects
- ✅ Both types show in project resource view
- ✅ Clear visual distinction between types

## API Endpoints Modified

### GET `/api/projects/{id}/resources`
**Query Logic**:
1. Fetch crews on project (`project_id = X, status = 'active'`)
2. Fetch crew equipment (`crew_id IN (crewIds), is_active = true`)
3. Fetch direct equipment (`project_id = X, crew_id IS NULL, is_active = true`)
4. Fetch crew vehicles (same pattern)
5. Fetch direct vehicles (same pattern)
6. Merge with `assignment_source` tag

### POST `/api/resources/equipment-assignments`
**Changes**:
- `crew_id` optional (was required)
- `project_id` required (was optional)
- Validates crew belongs to project
- Prevents concurrent crew assignments
- Allows direct project assignments

### POST `/api/resources/vehicle-assignments`
**Changes**: Same as equipment-assignments

## Database Schema Reference

### `equipment_assignments` table
```sql
- id: uuid (PK)
- equipment_id: uuid (FK → equipment.id)
- crew_id: uuid NULLABLE (FK → crews.id)      -- ✅ Already nullable
- project_id: uuid (FK → projects.id)
- from_ts: timestamptz
- to_ts: timestamptz (nullable)
- is_permanent: boolean
- rental_cost_per_day: numeric
- is_active: boolean
```

### `vehicle_assignments` table
```sql
- id: uuid (PK)
- vehicle_id: uuid (FK → vehicles.id)
- crew_id: uuid NULLABLE (FK → crews.id)      -- ✅ Already nullable
- project_id: uuid (FK → projects.id)
- from_ts: timestamptz
- to_ts: timestamptz (nullable)
- is_permanent: boolean
- rental_cost_per_day: numeric
- is_active: boolean
```

### `crews` table
```sql
- id: uuid (PK)
- name: text
- status: text
- project_id: uuid NULLABLE (FK → projects.id)
- leader_user_id: uuid (FK → users.id)
```

## Error Handling

### Concurrent Assignment Error
**Before**:
```
"Vehicle is already assigned to a crew. Only 1 vehicle per crew allowed."
```

**After**:
```
"Equipment is already assigned to crew \"Installation Team\". End the existing assignment first."
```

### Invalid Crew Error
**New**:
```
"Crew not found or not assigned to this project"
```

## Performance Considerations

### Query Optimization
- Uses parallel Promise.all() for crew-based and direct queries
- Conditional queries (only run crew queries if crews exist)
- Proper indexing on crew_id, project_id, is_active columns

### Caching Strategy
- `useProjectCrews` - 5 minute stale time
- `useProjectResources` - 5 minute stale time
- Query invalidation on mutations

## Migration Path

### For Existing Data
**No migration needed!** Existing assignments work as-is:
- Assignments with `crew_id` → crew-based assignments
- Assignments with `crew_id = NULL` → direct assignments

### For New Projects
1. Create project
2. Create crews (optional)
3. Assign resources either:
   - To crews (if crew management needed)
   - Directly to project (simple projects)
