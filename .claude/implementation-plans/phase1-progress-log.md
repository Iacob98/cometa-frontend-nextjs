## Detailed Progress

### Task 1.0: Create API Auth Utilities ✅

**Completed**: 2025-10-29 [timestamp]
**Time**: 45 minutes

**What was done**:
1. Created `src/lib/api-auth.ts` with comprehensive authentication utilities
2. Implemented `validateApiAuth()` - validates JWT tokens from Authorization header
3. Implemented `requireAuth()` - returns 401 if not authenticated
4. Implemented `requireRole()` - returns 403 if insufficient permissions
5. Implemented `canAccessProject()` - checks project access (PM/admin/crew)
6. Implemented `requireProjectAccess()` - combines auth + project authorization
7. Implemented `logSecurityEvent()` - security audit logging
8. Implemented `logUnauthorizedAccess()` - logs failed access attempts
9. Installed `jsonwebtoken` and `@types/jsonwebtoken` dependencies

**Files created**:
- `src/lib/api-auth.ts` (237 lines)

**Files modified**:
- `package.json` (added jsonwebtoken dependency)

**Key decisions**:
- Using JWT-based auth to match existing system
- Service role key still used (will be addressed in later task)
- Admin role bypasses project-specific checks
- PM and crew members need project assignment

**Testing done**:
- None yet (will test after securing all endpoints)

---

### Task 1.1: Secure GET Endpoint ✅

**Completed**: 2025-10-29 [timestamp]
**Time**: 15 minutes

**What was done**:
1. Added import for `validateApiAuth`, `requireProjectAccess`, `logUnauthorizedAccess`
2. Added authentication check at start of GET handler
3. Added project access authorization check
4. Added security logging for unauthorized attempts
5. Maintained existing error handling

**Files modified**:
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/soil-types/route.ts`:
  - Line 3: Added imports
  - Lines 67-79: Added auth + authz checks
  - Lines 81-96: Existing query logic (unchanged)

**Code changes**:
```typescript
// Added security checks
const authResult = await validateApiAuth(request);
const authError = await requireProjectAccess(authResult, projectId, supabase);
if (authError) {
  logUnauthorizedAccess(authResult.user?.id, `soil-types-read-${projectId}`, request);
  return authError;
}
```

**Security improvements**:
- ✅ Anonymous users get 401
- ✅ Authenticated users without project access get 403
- ✅ Admin can access any project
- ✅ PM can access their projects
- ✅ Crew members can access assigned projects
- ✅ All unauthorized attempts are logged

3. Added project access check
4. Added security logging for unauthorized attempts
5. Maintained existing validation and business logic

**Files modified**:
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/soil-types/route.ts`:
  - Line 3: Added `requireRole` import
  - Lines 110-133: Added auth + role + project access checks
  - Lines 135-160: Existing validation/insert logic (unchanged)

**Code changes**:
```typescript
// Added role-based security checks
const authResult = await validateApiAuth(request);
const roleError = requireRole(authResult, ['admin', 'pm']);
if (roleError) {
  logUnauthorizedAccess(authResult.user?.id, `soil-types-create-${projectId}`, request);
  return roleError;
}

// Added project access validation
const projectAccessError = await requireProjectAccess(authResult, projectId, supabase);
if (projectAccessError) {
  logUnauthorizedAccess(authResult.user?.id, `soil-types-create-${projectId}`, request);
  return projectAccessError;
}
```

**Security improvements**:

**Completed**: 2025-10-29 [timestamp]
**Time**: 20 minutes

**What was done**:
1. Added authentication check at start of DELETE handler
2. Added role-based authorization - ONLY admin and pm roles can delete
3. Added project access check

const roleError = requireRole(authResult, ['admin', 'pm']);
if (roleError) {
  logUnauthorizedAccess(authResult.user?.id, `soil-types-delete-${projectId}`, request);
  return roleError;
}

// Added project access validation
const projectAccessError = await requireProjectAccess(authResult, projectId, supabase);
if (projectAccessError) {
  logUnauthorizedAccess(authResult.user?.id, `soil-types-delete-${projectId}`, request);
  return projectAccessError;
}
```

**Security improvements**:
- ✅ Anonymous users get 401 Unauthorized
- ✅ Authenticated users without admin/pm role get 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Admin/PM without project access get 403 Forbidden
- ✅ Crew members (read-only) blocked from deleting

- ✅ Existing safety check maintained (soil type must belong to project)

**Testing done**:
- None yet (will test after all endpoints secured)

---

### Task 1.4: Remove PUT Endpoint ✅

**Completed**: 2025-10-29 [timestamp]
**Time**: 10 minutes

**What was done**:
1. Searched codebase for PUT endpoint usage with Grep
2. Confirmed no references to PUT endpoint in any component
3. Verified only GET, POST, DELETE methods used in [project-soil-types-card.tsx](src/components/project-soil-types-card.tsx:50)
4. Removed entire PUT handler (64 lines) from route.ts
5. Verified removal didn't break any functionality

**Files modified**:
- `src/app/api/projects/[id]/soil-types/route.ts`:
  - Lines 187-250: Removed PUT endpoint (64 lines)

**Rationale for removal**:
- PUT endpoint was never implemented in UI
- No API calls to PUT endpoint found in codebase
- Update functionality not needed (soil types can be deleted and re-created)
- Removing unused code improves maintainability and security surface

**Security impact**:
- ✅ Reduced attack surface (one less endpoint to secure)
- ✅ Eliminated potential vulnerability from unused code
- ✅ Simplified API interface

- ✅ Defense-in-depth protection at database level
- ✅ Role-based access: admin > pm > crew (read-only)

**Remaining work**: ~1-1.5 hours (automated tests, documentation)

### Task 1.5: Manual Testing ✅

**Completed**: 2025-10-29 [timestamp]
**Time**: 45 minutes

**What was done**:

✅ **Test 1: No authentication - PASSED**
- GET without token: 401 Unauthorized ✅
- POST without token: 401 Unauthorized ✅
- DELETE without token: 401 Unauthorized ✅

✅ **Test 2: Invalid token - PASSED**
- Request with invalid Bearer token: 401 Unauthorized ✅

✅ **Test 3: Crew role restrictions - PASSED**
- Crew user (K1_1@kometa.com) authenticated successfully
- POST attempt: 403 Forbidden with message "insufficient permissions" ✅
- DELETE attempt: 403 Forbidden with message "insufficient permissions" ✅
- Error response includes required_roles and user_role for debugging

✅ **Test 4: PM role access - PASSED**
- PM user (daniel@kometa.de) authenticated successfully
- GET soil types: 200 OK ✅
- POST new soil type: 201 Created with full object returned ✅
- DELETE soil type: 200 OK with success message ✅
- Project totals recalculated automatically after POST/DELETE

✅ **Test 5: Admin role access - PASSED**
- Admin user (admin@cometa.de) authenticated successfully
- GET from any project: 200 OK ✅
- POST to any project: 201 Created ✅
- DELETE from any project: 200 OK ✅
- Admin bypasses project ownership checks as expected

🐛 **CRITICAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED**:
- **Issue**: JWT_SECRET mismatch between login route and api-auth library
  - `login/route.ts` used: `"your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production"`
  - `api-auth.ts` used: `"cometa-secret-key"`
  - Result: All tokens failed validation with "invalid signature"
- **Fix**: Updated `api-auth.ts` line 49 to match login route secret
- **Impact**: Authentication now works correctly for all tests

🐛 **INTERFACE MISMATCH FOUND AND FIXED**:
- **Issue**: JWT payload uses `user_id` but AuthUser interface expected `id`
- **Fix**: Updated AuthUser interface to support both fields:
  - `id?: string` - Optional for backward compatibility
  - `user_id?: string` - JWT payload field
- **Fix**: Updated `requireProjectAccess` to extract userId correctly:
  - `const userId = user.user_id || user.id!;`
- **Impact**: Project access checks now work with JWT tokens

### Task 1.6: Create RLS Policies ✅

**Completed**: 2025-10-29 [timestamp]
**Time**: 20 minutes

**What was done**:
1. Created SQL migration file: `database/migrations/008_add_project_soil_types_rls.sql`
2. Enabled Row-Level Security on `project_soil_types` table
3. Created 4 comprehensive RLS policies:
   - **Admin policy**: Full access to all soil types (FOR ALL TO authenticated)
   - **PM policy**: Full access to their project soil types (FOR ALL TO authenticated)
   - **Crew policy**: Read-only access to assigned project soil types (FOR SELECT TO authenticated)
   - **Service role policy**: Bypass RLS for API operations (FOR ALL TO service_role)

**Files created**:
- `database/migrations/008_add_project_soil_types_rls.sql` (127 lines)

**Migration executed successfully**:
```sql
-- Results
ALTER TABLE
CREATE POLICY (x4)
RLS enabled: t (true)
4 policies active
```

**Policy Details**:

**1. Admin Policy** - Full Access
```sql
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users
    WHERE users.id = auth.uid()
    AND users.role = 'admin'
    AND users.is_active = true
  )
)
```

**2. PM Policy** - Manage Their Projects
```sql
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users
    JOIN projects ON projects.pm_user_id = users.id
    WHERE users.id = auth.uid()
    AND users.role = 'pm'
    AND users.is_active = true
    AND projects.id = project_soil_types.project_id
  )
)
```

**3. Crew Policy** - Read-Only via Crew Assignment
```sql
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users
    JOIN crew_members ON crew_members.user_id = users.id
    JOIN crews ON crews.id = crew_members.crew_id
    WHERE users.id = auth.uid()
    AND users.is_active = true
    AND crews.project_id = project_soil_types.project_id
  )
)
```

**4. Service Role Policy** - API Operations
```sql
USING (true)  -- Bypass all checks for service role
```

**Security Improvements**:
- ✅ Database-level enforcement (defense in depth)
- ✅ Complements application-level JWT auth
- ✅ Prevents direct database access bypassing API
- ✅ Service role can still perform admin operations
- ✅ Role-based access: admin > pm > crew (read-only)

**Note**: While RLS is now enabled, API routes still use service_role key which bypasses RLS. This is intentional as the application-level JWT auth (Task 1.1-1.3) provides the actual security layer. RLS serves as defense-in-depth protection.

## Issues Encountered

### Issue 1: JWT Secret Mismatch (Critical)
**Discovered**: During manual testing (Task 1.5)
**Symptom**: All authentication tokens failed validation with "invalid signature"
**Root cause**:
- `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts` uses default secret: `"your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production"`
- `src/lib/api-auth.ts` was using: `"cometa-secret-key"`
**Fix**: Updated `api-auth.ts` line 49 to match login route's default secret
**Impact**: Blocked ALL testing until fixed. CRITICAL security bug.
**Prevention**: Need to centralize JWT_SECRET in env variables and import from single source

### Issue 2: JWT Payload Interface Mismatch (High)
**Discovered**: During manual testing (Task 1.5)
**Symptom**: Project access checks failing even with valid tokens
**Root cause**:
- JWT payload uses `user_id` field (from login route)
- AuthUser interface expected `id` field
- `requireProjectAccess` function tried to access `user.id` which was undefined
**Fix**:
1. Updated AuthUser interface to support both `id?` and `user_id?`
2. Updated `requireProjectAccess` to extract: `const userId = user.user_id || user.id!;`
**Impact**: Project-level authorization completely broken until fixed
**Prevention**: Need consistent user ID field naming across codebase

---

## Notes for Review

- JWT_SECRET needs to be set in environment variables
- Service role key still in use (will address after basic auth working)
- No breaking changes to API response format
- Frontend will need to send Authorization header with token
